This folder contains different basic to advanced level standard coding problems based on Arrays.


Limitations of Array:
    1.Fixed size
    2.Contigious block of memory    (fixed length of memory divided into fixed sized memory blocks)
    3.Inserting or deleting is costly.
    4. Homogeneous --> single data type

finding size of an array:
    size = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
